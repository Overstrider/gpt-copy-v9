# One Shot

## Project Rules Gate

Before planning, executing, reviewing, or reporting completion, run `codedungeon rules status` and read `.codedungeon/project-rules.compact.md` when present. If rules are missing, warn the user and recommend `/codedungeon --rules` or `$codedungeon --rules`; do not silently invent project rules. If status is `draft` or `stale`, block `--full` and `--lite` unless the user explicitly says to proceed with stale rules; `--oneshot` may continue with a warning for small direct fixes.

Every plan, task file, review report, phase handoff, and final report must include this Project Rules envelope:

```text
PROJECT_RULES_STATUS: approved|missing|draft|stale
PROJECT_RULES_DIGEST: <rules_digest from codedungeon rules status or none>
PROJECT_RULES_READ: yes|no
```

Claude permission invariant: every Claude CLI session or subagent spawn controlled by codedungeon MUST include `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. This is mandatory and has no opt-out.

Deterministic completion gates:
- Use only `./.claude/bin/codedungeon` for CodeDungeon commands.
- Do not write review reports manually.
- Do not write final reports manually.
- Run standalone review with `./.claude/bin/codedungeon code-review --url <PR URL> --project-context .codedungeon/project-rules.compact.md --task-context .codedungeon/plans/one-shot/PLAN.md --out .codedungeon/code-review --post`.
- Run verification with `./.claude/bin/codedungeon qa run --phase 6 --fresh`.
- Run `./.claude/bin/codedungeon run finalize`; READY_FOR_USER_REVIEW can only come from `codedungeon run finalize`.

Minimal CodeDungeon workflow for a small change that still needs the safety rail of branch, commit, PR, and adversarial review.

Use when the request is narrow enough for one planner pass and one implementation pass. Do not split into task files, do not run the phase pipeline, and do not call `codedungeon-loop`.

## Parameters

- `$ARGUMENTS` - feature prompt or bugfix request.

## Required Outcome

End with:

- non-protected feature branch
- implementation committed
- branch pushed
- GitHub PR created or reused
- `/code-review` posted to the PR
- review verdict `APPROVED`
- final response in the standard CodeDungeon PR Report format

## Step 0: Validate

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty:

```text
Usage: /one-shot <feature or bugfix request>
```

Stop.

Run:

```bash
CD=./.claude/bin/codedungeon
[ -x "$CD" ] || { echo "Status BLOCKED: run project-local codedungeon setup before /one-shot"; exit 2; }
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree >/dev/null
git remote get-url origin >/dev/null
gh auth status
```

If git repo, `origin`, or `gh` auth validation fails, stop before editing and return a `BLOCKED` CodeDungeon PR Report. Never edit, commit, or push on `main`, `master`, `develop`, `dev`, `staging`, `production`, or `release`.

## Step 1: Plan

Inspect only the files needed to understand the request. Write a short plan to:

```text
.codedungeon/plans/one-shot/PLAN.md
```

The plan must contain:

```markdown
# One Shot Plan

## Request
<original request>

## Implementation
- <small ordered implementation steps>

## Verification
- <commands or manual checks>

## Review Focus
- <risk areas for code-review>
```

If the request clearly needs multi-step decomposition, cross-repo coordination, or a full QA/report pipeline, stop and recommend `/main-quest` instead.

## Step 2: Branch

Create or switch to a feature branch:

```bash
BRANCH="feat/$(echo "$ARGUMENTS" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g' | sed 's/--*/-/g' | sed 's/^-//;s/-$//' | cut -c1-50)"
[ "$BRANCH" = "feat/" ] && BRANCH="feat/one-shot"
git switch -c "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || git switch "$BRANCH"
$CD git guard --repo .
```

If guard fails here, stop before editing.

## Step 3: Implement

Implement directly from the plan. Keep edits scoped. Add or run the smallest meaningful tests before claiming done.

Do not create `.codedungeon/tasks/*` for this workflow.

## Step 4: Verify

Run every verification command from the plan. If no command was obvious, run the nearest project check from the manifest:

- Go: `go test ./...`
- Rust: `cargo test`
- Node: `npm test` or package script closest to test
- Python: `python -m pytest`

If verification cannot run, record the blocker in the final report and continue only if the change can still be reviewed.

## Step 5: Commit, Push, PR

Run:

```bash
$CD git guard --repo .
git status --short
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: one-shot update"
git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
PR_URL=$(gh pr view --json url -q .url 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ -z "$PR_URL" ]; then
  PR_URL=$(gh pr create --fill)
fi
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
echo "$PR_URL"
```

If the PR already exists, reuse it. If no PR exists, create one.
If `PR_URL` or `PR_NUMBER` is empty after this step, stop and return a `BLOCKED` CodeDungeon PR Report.

## Step 6: Review

Run `/code-review` until the PR review verdict is `APPROVED` or 9 cycles are exhausted.

Cycles:
- 1-3: full adversarial mode.
- 4-9: reduced adversarial mode. Keep all personas, but use fast model/effort and review only the fixes or new diff since the previous review cycle.

For each cycle:

```text
REVIEW_CYCLE=<1-9>
REVIEW_MODE=<full|reduced>
/code-review .
```

After each review, verify that a review comment was posted to the PR:

```bash
ADV_REVIEW_COUNT=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --comments --json comments -q '[.comments[] | select(.body | test("Claude Adversarial Code Review"))] | length')
```

If `ADV_REVIEW_COUNT` is `0`, stop and return `BLOCKED`. If review returns `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, fix the findings directly, commit, push, and rerun `/code-review`. After 9 cycles, stop with `MAX_CYCLES_REACHED`.

## Step 7: Report

Always return this exact format. `Status READY_FOR_USER_REVIEW` is valid only when the PR exists and remains open, the branch is pushed, `codedungeon review post` recorded the adversarial review comment, and the final verdict is `APPROVED`. Do not merge; the user performs final review and merge.
