# Phase 5: Execution (Dev)

Claude permission invariant: every Claude CLI session or subagent spawn controlled by codedungeon MUST include `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. This is mandatory and has no opt-out.

**You are a phase agent.** Read these instructions, execute them, then update pipeline-state.md.

## Inputs
- Pipeline state: `.codedungeon/plan/pipeline-state.md` (read this FIRST for config, repo map, env vars)
- `.codedungeon/plan/MASTER.md` (execution order)
- `.codedungeon/tasks/{feature-name}/{repo-name}/PLAN.md` per repo
- `.codedungeon/tasks/{feature-name}/{repo-name}/task-*.md` (dev task files)

## Outputs
- Feature branches with committed code per repo
- Pull requests per repo
- Adversarial review comments on PRs (via `/code-review`)
- Update `.codedungeon/plan/pipeline-state.md`: set Phase 5 status to DONE + list artifacts + results
- Populate `## Results (per repo)` section with PR numbers, verdicts, task counts

### PHASE 5: Execution (Dev)

**Goal**: Execute dev tasks for each repo via codedungeon-loop, in execution order.

#### Step 5.1: Read Execution Order

Read the MASTER.md to determine repo execution order.

#### Step 5.2: Execute Each Repo (Sequential, Isolated)

For each repo in execution order:

1. Determine paths:
   ```
   # Multi-repo mode:
   TASK_DIR = .codedungeon/tasks/{feature-name}/{repo-name}/

   # Single-repo mode (repo-name = "."):
   TASK_DIR = .codedungeon/tasks/{feature-name}/root/

   PLAN_FILE = {TASK_DIR}/PLAN.md
   ```

2. **Resolve the absolute path to codedungeon-loop.md** before spawning the agent:
   - Use: `{project_root}/.codedungeon/commands/codedungeon-loop.md`
   - Set `LOLDINIS_LOOP_PATH` to that absolute path (use the Read tool to verify)
   - If it does not exist, STOP with error: "codedungeon-loop.md not found. Run `codedungeon install`."

3. Announce to user:
   > Spawning execution agent for **{repo}** ({lang}) — {N} tasks

4. Spawn a `general-purpose` agent with **model: `claude-sonnet-4-6`**:

   ```
   You are executing the codedungeon-loop for a single repo.

   Read the full codedungeon-loop instructions from: {LOLDINIS_LOOP_PATH}
   (This is an ABSOLUTE path — read it with the Read tool before doing anything else.)
   If you cannot read the file above, STOP with error — do NOT improvise.

   Execute with these parameters:
   TASK_DIR = {TASK_DIR}

   Follow the codedungeon-loop protocol exactly:
   - Validate input (Step 0)
   - Branch setup (Main Loop Step 1)
   - Orchestrator loop: dispatch each task
     - {lang}-specialist (Plan mode) → general-purpose agent (exec) → {lang}-specialist (Review mode)
   - Commit per task
   - Push, create PR (with context from MASTER.md)
   - Run /code-review for PR review (Main Loop Step 5) — see REVIEW PROTOCOL below
   - Fix issues if needed (loop continues until APPROVED — no cycle cap stops the loop)

   ## REVIEW PROTOCOL — /code-review (adversarial, claude-sonnet-4-6 4.7 fanout)
   For Main Loop Step 5 (PR review), you MUST read and follow the full /code-review
   protocol from: {project_root}/.codedungeon/commands/code-review.md

   /code-review runs a multi-persona adversarial fanout (Saboteur + New Hire + Security Auditor
   + Spec Enforcer on claude-sonnet-4-6 4.7) followed by per-finding claude-sonnet-4-6 Validators and a stack-specific
   {LANG}-specialist pass. It always produces a verdict (APPROVED or CHANGES_REQUESTED) — there
   is NO "skip" case.

   Review cycles are capped at 9. Cycles 1-3 use full adversarial mode. Cycles 4-9 use reduced
   mode: keep all personas, use fast model/effort, and focus on fixes or new diff since the
   previous cycle.

   CRITICAL: This is the ONLY review path. Codex, OpenRouter, Qwen, and any external reviewers
   have been removed from the pipeline. Do NOT invent a fallback chain; /code-review is always
   available because it is pure Claude Code.

   ## NEVER SKIP (verified after you complete)
   - NEVER skip Phase C (specialist review) for any task — the orchestrator will check that review.md contains an APPROVED verdict for every [x] task
   - NEVER skip Main Loop Step 5 (/code-review) — the orchestrator will verify a review comment exists on the PR via `gh`
   - NEVER mark a task [x] without Phase C approval
   - NEVER report completion without providing ALL of these fields in your final report

   ## Required Report Format
   Your FINAL message must include the standard CodeDungeon PR Report. `Status READY_FOR_USER_REVIEW` is valid
   only when the PR exists and remains open, the branch is pushed, `codedungeon review post` recorded the adversarial review comment,
   and the final verdict is APPROVED.

   +------------------------------------------------+
   | CodeDungeon PR Report                          |
   +------------------------------------------------+
   | Status        READY_FOR_USER_REVIEW|BLOCKED|MAX_CYCLES_REACHED
   | Workflow      codedungeon-loop
   | PR            #{number} {url}
   | Branch        {branch}
   | Review        APPROVED|CHANGES_REQUESTED|MAX_CYCLES_REACHED|NOT_RUN

   Summary
   {1-line task/result summary}

   Review
   - Adversarial comments: {N}
   - Last review marker: Claude Adversarial Code Review|none
   - Remaining findings: {none or short list/count}

   Work Done
   - Tasks: {N}/{total}
   - Changed files: {short summary or none}
   - Verification: {commands/results or blocker}

   PR
   {url or "not created"}

   Next
   {none or exact next human/agent action}
   ```

5. **Verify Phase 5 output** before accepting:

   a. **Parse the agent's report** for required fields:
      - `PR_NUMBER`, `PR_URL`, `REVIEW_VERDICT`
      - If any field is missing: log WARNING "Agent did not report {field}. Verifying manually..."

   b. **Verify PR exists**:
      ```bash
      cd {REPO_DIR} && gh pr list --head {BRANCH_NAME} --json number -q '.[0].number'
      ```
      - If no PR: log ERROR "No PR found for {repo}. Phase 5 incomplete."
      - Do NOT proceed to Phase 6 for this repo.

   c. **Verify adversarial review was posted** (exact title match — /code-review always posts this):
      ```bash
      cd {REPO_DIR} && gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --comments --json comments -q '[.comments[] | select(.body | test("Claude Adversarial Code Review"))] | length'
      ```
      - If count = 0: log ERROR "No adversarial review comment found on PR #{PR_NUMBER}. /code-review was not invoked — Phase 5 incomplete."
      - /code-review has no skip path, so zero comments indicates a pipeline break.

   d. Report verification result:
      > **{repo}** verified: PR #{PR_NUMBER} — Review: {REVIEW_VERDICT}

6. Move to next repo.

## Output mode + completion

```bash
codedungeon prompts get caveman-ultra   # inject CAVEMAN block into any sub-agent spawn
```

When this phase is DONE, close it atomically:

```bash
codedungeon phase done 5 \
  --verdict APPROVED \
  --summary "<1-line caveman>" \
  --decisions "<d1>" "<d2>" \
  --artifacts "<path1>" "<path2>" \
  --next "<path the next phase must read first>" \
  --promise "PHASE_5_COMPLETE"
```

Writes DB row + `.codedungeon/state/phase-5-output.md` + updates `pipeline-state.md`.

Use `codedungeon phase skip 5 --reason "..."` or `... fail 5 --reason "..."` for non-DONE terminal states.

## Tool discipline

Phase-agent = orchestrator. Allowed: `Task` (spawn workers), `Read` (state + handoff files), `Bash` (for `codedungeon` + `git` + tool calls). Forbidden: `Write`/`Edit` on artifact files (arcplan.md, plans, task files, review files) — workers own those.

Thinking budget inherited from `PHASE_THINKING[5]` in the orchestrator (`main-quest.md`). Model tier via `codedungeon config model <reasoning|fast>` (Sprint 7).
