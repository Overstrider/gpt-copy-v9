Claude permission invariant: every Claude CLI session or subagent spawn controlled by codedungeon MUST include `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. This is mandatory and has no opt-out.

# summoning-circle-spawn

Reference for how Loldinis agents spawn subagents. Every agent that spawns inherits these rules so isolation, model pinning, and ROI tracking stay consistent.

## §8.1 — Type matrix

| Use case | subagent_type | model | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deep codebase search (open-ended, multi-query) | `general-purpose` | inherit | Only when parent's Read+Grep won't cut it. |
| Fast glob/grep (one-shot) | (do NOT spawn — parent calls Grep/Glob directly) | — | Spawning for one search wastes tokens. |
| Architecture plan | `dragon-architect-planner` | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Phase 1 only. |
| Consolidated domain plan (rust/nextjs/kotlin) | via Skill loader: `{lang}-{role}-agent` MODE=plan | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Phase 2'. |
| Consolidated review (rust/nextjs/kotlin) | Skill MODE=review | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Phase 5 review loop. |
| Language reviewer (go/python/elixir/cpp) | `{lang}-reviewer` | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Shrunk reviewer. Reads companion checklist on demand. |
| QA plan / refine | `basilisk-planner-qa` | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Phases 3.5, 5.5. |
| Task decomposition (dev or test) | `spider-architect-task` MODE=dev or test | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Phases 4 and 5.6. |
| Project startup | `phoenix-project-startup` | claude-sonnet-4-6 | On-demand. |
| Test execution (api / frontend / mobile) | `mimic-tester-api` or `wraith-tester-frontend` or `test-mobile` | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Phase 6. |
| Push + report | `general-purpose` | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Phase 7 only. |

**Rule:** never spawn a subagent you could replace with a direct tool call (Read / Grep / Glob / Bash). The ROI hook (§8.4 below) logs a warning if spawn input > 10x output tokens.

## §8.2 — Spawn prompt template

Every subagent spawn MUST include the following blocks, in order:

```
{CAVEMAN_ULTRA_BLOCK}

You are {subagent_identity}. {role_one_line}.

Load instructions from: {path_to_SKILL.md_or_agent_md}

If you cannot load instructions, STOP and emit:
{TYPE}_DEFINITION_MISSING: {path}

MODE={mode_if_multimode}
PROJECT_MODE={BOOTSTRAP|SINGLE|MULTI}

Required reads (narrow context first):
- {handoff_file_from_prev_phase}
- {specific_inputs_for_this_task}

Your job:
{imperative 1-sentence job description}.

Return contract:
- Write {expected_output_path}.
- Final line of output MUST match canonical promise at end of SKILL.md (P6 of A2A rules).

max_thinking_tokens: {per §12 table}
model: {per §2 table}
```

**Never** let a spawn prompt carry the full codebase or full arcplan — only the narrow slice the subagent needs. Handoff files (§6) exist for this purpose.

## §8.3 — Return contract

Every subagent MUST:
1. Write its artifact to a named file path (not return prose).
2. End the artifact with a canonical completion promise (e.g., `PLAN_COMPLETE: {path}`, `REVIEW_COMPLETE: {task-id}`, `TESTS_PASS`).
3. Return **only** a 1-line status to the parent (`SUCCESS: {artifact_path}` or `FAIL: {reason, <=100 chars}`).

Parent agents MUST NOT parse prose beyond that 1-line status. The artifact is the context bridge (P7 of A2A rules).

## §8.4 — ROI hook

On every SubagentStop, the hook `subagent-stop.sh` appends one JSONL entry to `.codedungeon/state/subagent-metrics.jsonl`:

```
{"ts":"2026-04-21T18:00:00Z","type":"general-purpose","in_tokens":1200,"out_tokens":180,"ratio":6.67}
```

`ratio = in_tokens / out_tokens`. If `ratio < 10` -> the spawn may not have been worth it. Review the logs when the subagent-metrics tail shows sustained low ratios.

## Usage from other skills

Agents and skills reference this by name in their own SKILL.md:

> Subagent spawning: follow `summoning-circle-spawn/SKILL.md` — type matrix, spawn template, return contract, ROI hook.

Do NOT re-document the rules elsewhere. Keep this file as the single source of truth.
